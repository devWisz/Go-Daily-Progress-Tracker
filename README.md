## Why I Built This

Most productivity apps are filled with distractions, unnecessary features, or too much fluff.

I wanted something simple.

This is not just a program.

This is my daily learning tracker. Built for real use. Built for myself.  
A focused, clutter-free way to journal what I actually did each day.  
And now, shared with the world.
